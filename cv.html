        I have Diploma in Classical music from the Higher institute of music Damascus Syria specialization (Classical Guitar) and because I believe there is a deep bond between Art and  
        human thought I studied philosophy for two years  in Lebanon university.<br>
        After that I traveled to Granada Spain and I studied there Classical Guitar in Amati institute and Spanish language.<br>
        In 2008 I had a full scholarship from the Ministry of high education in Syria to study Music for one year in Kiev Ukraine.<br>Now I am studying programing in Amsterdam with Hack your future group.</p>

        My main work In Syria was a Guitar professor in the Higher Institute of Music in Damascus since 2011 until I had to leave Syria in 2015.<br> before and during that I enrolled my self in many different kind of jobs because I believe that we did not born to do one thing and each thing we do will add a new color or dimension to our life.<br> 
        I gave a periodical lectures in Homs university about the history of Music in general and The Classical Guitar in particular<br>
        I worked two years in medical company MBC the first year as a supervisor and the second year as an assistance to the Director of Marketing in the factory.<br>
